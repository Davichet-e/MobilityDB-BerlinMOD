			We describe next the main steps in the generation of the BerlinMOD scenario. The generator uses multiple parameters that can be set to customize the generation process. We explain in detail these parameters in <a class="xref" href="ch02s09.html" title="Tuning the Generator Parameters">the section called “Tuning the Generator Parameters”</a>. It is worth noting that the procedures explained in this section have been slightly simplified with respect to the actual procedures by removing ancillary details concerning the generation of tracing messages at various verbosity levels.
		</p><p>
			We start by creating a first set of tables for containing the generated data as follows.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">

END IF;

  (i, homeNode, workNode), (i, workNode, homeNode);

</pre><p>
			We start by storing in the <code class="varname">Vehicles</code> table the home and the work node of each vehicle. Depending on the value of the variable <code class="varname">nodeChoice</code>, we chose these nodes either with a uniform distribution among all nodes in the network or we call specific functions that take into account population and employment statistics in the area covered by the generation. We then keep track in the <code class="varname">Destinations</code> table of the two trips to and from work and we store in the <code class="varname">Licences</code> table information describing the vehicle. Finally, we compute in the <code class="varname">Neighbourhood</code> table the set of nodes that are within a given distance of the home node of every vehicle. This distance is stated by the parameter <code class="varname">P_NEIGHBOURHOOD_RADIUS</code>, which is set by default to 3 Km.
		</p><p>
			We create now auxiliary tables containing benchmarking data. The number of rows these tables is determined by the parameter <code class="varname">P_SAMPLE_SIZE</code>, which is set by default to 100. These tables are used by the BerlinMOD benchmark to assess the performance of various types of queries.

			We generate now the leisure trips. There is at most one leisure trip in the evening of a week day and at most two leisure trips each day of the weekend, one in the morning and another one in the afternoon. Each leisure trip is composed of 1 to 3 destinations. The leisure trip starts and ends at the home node and visits successively these destinations. In our implementation, the various subtrips from a source to a destination node of a leisure trip are encoded independently, contrary to what is done in Secondo where a leisure trip is encoded as a single trip and stops are added between successive destinations.

			For each vehicle and each day, we determine the number of potential leisure trips depending on whether it is a week or weekend day. A leisure trip is generated with a probability of 40% and is composed of 1 to 3 destinations. These destinations are chosen so that 80% of the destinations are from the neighbourhood of the vehicle and 20% are from the complete graph. The information about the composition of the leisure trips is then added to the <code class="varname">LeisureTrip</code> and <code class="varname">Destinations</code> tables.

			The variable <code class="varname">pathMode</code> determines whether pgRouting computes either the fastest or the shortest path from a source to a destination node. Then, we determine the number of calls to pgRouting. Indeed, depending on the available memory of the computer, there is a limit in the number of paths to be computed by pgRouting in a single call. The paths are stored in the <code class="varname">Paths</code> table. In addition to the columns generated by pgRouting, we add the geometry (adjusting the direction if necessary), the maximum speed, and the category of the edge. The BerlinMOD data generator considers three road categories: side road, main road, and freeway. The OSM road types are mapped to one of these categories in the function <code class="varname">berlinmod_roadCategory</code>.

			We create a type <code class="varname">step</code> which is a record composed of the geometry, the maximum speed, and the category of an edge. The procedure loops for each vehicle and each day and calls the procedure <code class="varname">createTrip</code> for creating the trips. If the day is a weekday, we generate the trips from home to work and from work to home starting, respectively, at 8 am and 4 pm plus a random non-zero duration of 120 minutes using a uniform distribution. We then generate the leisure trips. During the week days, the possible evening leisure trip starts at 8 pm plus a random random non-zero duration of 90 minutes, while during the weekend days, the two possible morning and afternoon trips start, respectively, at 9 am and 5 pm plus a random non-zero duration of 120 minutes. Between the multiple destinations of a leisure trip we add a delay time of maximum 120 minutes using a bounded Gaussian distribution.

			The procedure receives as first argument a path from a source to a destination node, which is an array of triples composed of the geometry, the maximum speed, and the category of an edge of the path. The other arguments are the timestamp at which the trip starts and a Boolean value determining whether the points composed the trip are disturbed to simulate GPS errors. The output of the function is a temporal geometry point following this path. The procedure loops for each edge of the path and determines the number of segments of the edge, where a segment is a straight line defined by two consecutive points. For each segment, we determine the angle between the current segment and the next one (if any) to compute the maximum speed at the turn. This is determined by multiplying the maximum speed of the segment by a factor proportional to the angle so that the factor is 1.00 at both 0° and 360° and is 0.0 at 180°. Examples of values of degrees and the associated factor are given next.

			Each segment is divided in fractions of length <code class="varname">P_EVENT_LENGTH</code>, which is by default 5 meters. We then loop for each fraction and choose to add one event that can be an acceleration, a deceleration, or a stop event. If the speed of the vehicle is zero, only an accelation event can happen. For this, we increase the current speed with the value of <code class="varname">P_EVENT_ACC</code>, which is by default 12 Km/h, and verify that the speed is not greater than the maximum speed of either the edge or the next turn for the last fraction. Otherwise, if the current speed is not zero, we apply a deceleration or a stop event with a probability proportional to the maximum speed of the edge, otherwise we apply an acceleration event. After applying the event, if the speed is zero we add a waiting time with a random exponential distribution with mean <code class="varname">P_DEST_EXPMU</code>, which is by default 1 second. Otherwise, we move the current position towards the end of the segment and, depending on the variable <code class="varname">disturbData</code>, we disturbe the new position to simulate GPS errors. The timestamp at which the vehicle reaches the new position is determined by dividing the distance traversed by the current speed. Finally, at the end of each segment, if the current speed is not zero, we add a stop event depending on the categories of the current segment and the next one. This is determined by a transition matrix given by the parameter <code class="varname">P_DEST_STOPPROB</code>.
